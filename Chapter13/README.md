# Chapter 13: Recommender System; Getting to Know Their Taste

In this chapter, we will learn about the different approaches used by recommender systems. We will mainly use a sister library to scikit-learn called Surprise. Surprise is a toolkit that implements different collaborative filtering algorithms. So, we will start by learning the differences between the collaborative filtering algorithms and the content-based filtering algorithms used in a recommendation engine. We will also learn how to package our trained models to be used by other software without the need for retraining. The following topics will be discussed here:

- The different recommendation paradigms  
- Downloading Surprise and the dataset
- Using KNN-inspired algorithms
- Using baseline algorithms
- Using singular value decomposition
- Deploying machine learning models in production
